## Abstract

The Graph Network vision is of decentralized participants providing consumers with trusted access to the world's public data. The better the incentives for all contribution to value creation are, the better the network collectively creates value for both consumers and participants, and the fairer the distribution of value. Our analysis has identified opportunities to better leverage decentralized expertise to enhance value. We propose an opinionated incentivization structure for Data Services to better incentivize the decentralized and diverse nature of value creation opportunity. Thereby we increase the value provided to consumers, and fairly share that value across decentralized and diverse contributors and roles.
