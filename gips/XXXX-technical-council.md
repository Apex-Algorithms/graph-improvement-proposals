# Abstract

The Graph Protocol should establish a Technical Council, whose responsibility is to support The Graph Council and the wider ecosystem in reviewing technical plans, proposals & implementations.

# Motivation

Making decisions about the development of The Graph Protocol requires deep technical understanding across a wide range of subject areas. The Graph's core developers have significant expertise in these areas, but there is not currently a formal mechanism to ensure that expertise is brought to bear during the proposal, planning and review process.

Introducing a formal mechanism in the form of a Technical Council will make the process of review more thorough, and increase the confidence of The Graph Council in approving more technical proposals when they reach the final review stage.

# High Level Description

The Technical Council will have the following responsibilities:

- Reviewing GIPs with significant technical components
- Supporting The Graph Council in answering technical questions
- Supporting The Graph Foundation in making and assessing technical grants
- Generating GRPs based on technical requirements

The Technical Council's membership will be made up of nominees from The Graph Foundation and core development teams. In order to keep the working group small & nimble, each team will only nominate one member to the council. That nominated member will be responsible for bringing in additional expertise, as well as socialising pertinent information across their teams.

The Technical Council will meet on an as-needed basis, but at least once per month. The Graph Foundation's nominee will be responsible for coordination.
