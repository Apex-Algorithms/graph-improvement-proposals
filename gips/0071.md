## Abstract

Since inception The Graph protocol has successfully used Indexing Rewards to incentivize Indexers to participate on the network. Graph Horizon is evolving related protocol mechanisms and will make Indexing Rewards obsolete. A Graph Horizon aligned replacement for Indexing Rewards is proposed that links issuance distribution to the quality and value of service value delivered, by using direct market mechanisms to balance and match supply to demand for the benefit of both consumers and providers.
